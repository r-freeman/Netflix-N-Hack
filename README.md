# Instructions

### Extended Storage Setup 

> [!WARNING]
> This will wipe your drive.

**Disclaimer:** Only works on PS5s that have an activated account. Real PSN account or Fake activated via jailbreak.

**Do not update your console to activate!** Use System backup method below

### Extended Storage Drive Setup (PS4)

#### Step 1: Download balenaEtcher
- Download **balenaEtcher** for Windows, macOS, or Linux from:
  [https://etcher.balena.io](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher)

#### Step 2: Download the Image Archive
- Download the **`.7z` archive** for your region from the [**Releases** section.](https://github.com/earthonion/Netflix-N-Hack/releases/tag/External-Drive) For PS4 the Images are Netflix_PS4_xx.7z ,US/EU/AS to indicate the region they are for.
> [!NOTE]
> Extended Storage does not require an exact capacity beyond the minimum of 256GB. Meaning that if your drive is 256GB you can use the image. If your drive is 500GB you can use the image. Or if it is 1TB you can use the image and etc up to 8TB. But if it is 250GB you cannot use the image.**
- The `.7z` download size is roughly ~**95-200 MB** and around 400MB unpacked.

#### Moving the Netflix App to Internal Storage
1. Go to Settings -> Storage -> Extended Storage -> Applications  -> [Press Options on controller] -> Move To System Storage
2. Press X on the Netflix App to tick and select it. 
3. Go to "Move" and press X.
4. Press OK on the prompt to move the app to internal storage. It will then move to internal storage and be usable for the exploit. Accessible from the Media tab of the XMB.

### Extended Storage Drive Setup (PS5)

### M.2 Drive Setup (PCIe Gen 4 NVMe for PS5)

#### Step 1: Download balenaEtcher
- Download **balenaEtcher** for Windows, macOS, or Linux from:
  [https://etcher.balena.io](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher)
  
#### Step 2: Download the Image Archive
- Download the **`.7z` archive** for your desired capacity from the [**Releases** section.](https://github.com/earthonion/netflix-n-hack/releases)
  - NOTE: **Exact capacity matters for M.2 Images only** - not all 1TB drives are 1000GB: some are 1024GB, same with 2000/2048, 4000/4096; choose carefully!
- The `.7z` download size is roughly ~**95-200 MB**. Unpacked files range from ~**95100MB-4GB**.

#### Step 3: Extract the ZIP Image
- Extract the downloaded `.7z` file.
- Inside, you will see a `.zip` image file, with size depending on the target SSD:


  - **256 GB image:** ~**380 MB** `.zip`
  - **500 GB image:** ~**670 MB** `.zip`
  - **1 TB image:** ~**1.2 GB** `.zip`
  - **2 TB image:** ~**2.3 GB** `.zip`
  - **4 TB image:** ~**3.9 GB** `.zip`

  <ins>**This `.zip` is what you will flash with balenaEtcher.**</ins>

> **Note:** When you load this image in balenaEtcher, you may see a
> `Missing partition table` warning. This is expected for encrypted PS5 drives.
> It is safe to click **Continue**.


#### Step 4: Write the Image with balenaEtcher
1. Connect your **M.2 SSD (PCIe Gen 4 NVMe)** to your computer (using a dock/enclosure or spare M.2 slot).
2. Open **balenaEtcher**.
3. Click **“Flash from file”** and select the extracted **`.zip`** image for your chosen capacity.
4. Click **“Select target”** and choose your **M.2 SSD**.
5. Click **“Flash!”** to start the process.

> Approximate flashing times (varies depending on M.2 dock/enclosure speed and your CPU):
> - **256 GB image:** ~**10 minutes**
> - **500 GB image:** ~**15 minutes**
> - **1 TB image:** ~**25 minutes**
> - **2 TB image:** ~**45 minutes**
> - **4 TB image:** ~**80 minutes**
>
> Etcher will appear stuck at **0%** for a while, then at **85-99%** for several minutes.
> This is normal, let it finish without interruption!
> If you encounter damaged image warnings, reboot your pc, redownload the image or use a different enclosure/motherboard slot for the m.2 SSD.

#### Step 5: Install the M.2 Drive in the PS5
- Power off the PS5 completely.
- Install the imaged **M.2 SSD** into the PS5’s internal M.2 slot.
- Power the PS5 back on; the console should now see the preinstalled Netflix app, viewable under `Storage` settings.
- Move app from the M.2 to console storage, then reformat the M.2 drive in under `Storage` settings to safely continue using it.

#### Step 6: Move the Netflix App to Internal Storage

# How to run proxy locally

## Requirements

- Python (for `mitmproxy`)
- `mitmproxy` (`pip install mitmproxy`)

pip install mitmproxy

# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/earthonion/Netflix-N-Hack/
cd Netflix-N-Hack

# run mitmproxy with the provided script
mitmproxy -s proxy.py

```

Current script will trigger after the WebSocket for remote logging is initiated.

```bash
# install websockets
pip install websockets

# Generate Keys
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost"

# run WebSocket server
python ws.py

```

### Network / Proxy Setup

On your PS5:

1. Go to Settings > Network > Settings > Set Up Internet Connection.

const ip_script = "10.0.0.2"; // IP address of computer running mitmproxy.
const ip_script_port = 8080; //port which mitmproxy is running on

```

> Make sure your PC running mitmproxy is on the same network and reachable at the IP you entered.

### Open Netflix and wait.
